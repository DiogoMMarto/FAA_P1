III. PROJECT ASSESMENT (25 % of the final grade)

1. Report. The project is evaluated based on a submitted report (IEEE Latex format). The work done
by each student has to be explicitly specified.
All project’s files (pdf and Latex files of the report, the presentation slides and the code
implementing the algorithms) are submitted to the elearning.ua.pt page of the course in section
SUBMISSION – PROJECT 1 in a compressed format having the following name:
P1_ML2024_XXXXX_YYYYY (where XXXXX and YYYYY are substituted by the student number of each
student.

2. Oral presentation of the report in class (about 10-15 min.).
IV. Evaluation criteria (total score 20)

1. Report content (12):
- Data description and preprocessing (if necessary normalization, feature selection,
transformation, etc.). Motivation for choosing the particular problem.
- Data visualization (histograms, box plots, other plots).
- Short description of the implemented ML models.
- Model training (data splitting – train, validate, test, k-fold Cross validation). Visualize graphically
the cost function trajectory over iterations. Training with regularized or non-regularized cost
function.
- Model hyper-parameter selection – systematic approach instead of randomly chosen values.
- For a classification problem, you need to present the confusion Matrix (accuracy, precision,
recall, F1 score, etc.).
- Performance comparison between the models.
- Results in graphical or table formats.
- Conclusions.
- Problem complexity.

2. Report formatting (2) :
- IEEE Latex format, affiliation (Department, University, subject, course instructor), abstract,
keywords, work load per student.
- Sufficiently detailed report.
- References, reference citation in the report.
- Clear figures (title, legends, axis labels) and tables referred in the text.

3. Oral presentation (3)
- Slide Organization, slide numbers, affiliation.
- Clear and convincing presentation by both students.

4. Novelty and contributions (3)
- Compare your solution with the works of other authors (published references) , try to propose
a better solution, e.g. improve the performance of the ML model in solving the problem you work
with.
